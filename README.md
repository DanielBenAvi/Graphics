Implemantation of path finding algorithms

1. Best First Search (greedy)
2. A* Search

## Best First Search (greedy)

Best First Search is a greedy algorithm that selects the path that appears to be the best at that moment. It does not consider the cost of the path to that node. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the path to the goal. It is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.

## A* Search

A* Search is a best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the path to the goal. It uses the sum of the cost of the path from the start node to the current node and the heuristic function to estimate the cost of the path from the current node to the goal. It is guaranteed to find the shortest path.
